        1. Posting a message on the website, chat, game, or forum implies your acceptance of RomuStrike's code of conduct.<br />
        2. Messages appearing on the website, chat, game, or forum express the author's opinion and not that of RomuStrike, nor that of others. Furthermore, RomuStrike is not responsible for the content of the messages found there.<br />
        3. You agree not to publish abusive, obscene, vulgar, defamatory, shocking, threatening, sexually oriented, or otherwise illegal content on the website, chat, game, and forum that may violate French or international laws. Doing so may result in immediate and permanent banning, with notification to your internet service provider if deemed necessary.<br />
        4. You are allowed only one account in the game. You cannot change the username unless approved by moderators. Creating multiple accounts to ensure the proper functioning of our database is prohibited.<br />
        5. You cannot modify game files (models, weapons, images, maps) if you use them in the game or publish them. However, you can use them in the designated game modes (Debug mode and LAN mode).<br />
        6. You commit to not exploit game flaws to gain points. Instead, if you find any, we encourage you to report them on the game's forum.<br />
        7. You accept that personal data (email, IP, cookies, browser, system information, and hardware information) will be collected to enable the proper functioning of the website and the game (game login, statistics, moderation). These data will not be used to infringe upon your digital freedoms and will be stored in a database.<br />
        8. The email address provided during your registration must be valid and able to establish contact with you. Therefore, it should be checked regularly.<br />
        9. RomuStrike endeavors to moderate the website, chat, game, and forum and reserves the right to remove, for any reason, all disruptive or inappropriate messages. Since each message appears online immediately and moderation is done manually, it's impossible for RomuStrike to review all messages. Considering the constraints, RomuStrike will moderate the website, chat, game, and forum as actively as possible.<br />
        10. RomuStrike's removal of one or more forum messages does not relieve the author of responsibility for the content of the messages they have posted on the website, chat, game, or forum.<br />
        11. All forms of advertising, chain letters, and inappropriate questions are strictly prohibited.<br />
        12. In case of non-compliance with this code of conduct, RomuStrike reserves the right to ban the concerned individual, delete all their messages, and remove their account.<br />
        13. As the game is free, consider that it's developed by individuals contributing their free time and striving to improve it day by day.<br />
        14. We commit to respecting the freedoms owed to you to the extent that they are in line with this regulation.<br />
        15. On RomuStrike, the creator of a map is its master. They can remove anyone for any reason. Don't complain about being removed without reason, as they establish the rules as they wish.<br />
